                            <p>How lovely it would be to find true love, But if it's not yours. I want nothing, that's sincere.
                                Every day I await your reply, your voice in the wind. Yet your words told me, "forgetting is the remedy."
                                Now it hurts to remember you, my heart in sleeplessness. Did you perhaps have a point with your cold, precise advice?
                                I want to keep loving you, to hold you in my arms again, You who taught me to love, in a sweet renewal.
                                You were my instructed me. teacher, in love you Why were you so cruel when you left me? Why did you leave me alone, lost in the void.
                                I need your words, your affection, your warmth. Saying goodbye was painful, a wound in the soul. But remembering you now, tears more deeply.
                                My love for you endures, in every sigh and song, Though you're no longer here, in my heart, you always belong</p>

                            <p>You are like the dawn, sometimes sweet, sometimes heavy. I love to gaze upon your face, though not when it shines for others. 
                                Your touch in my hair is a whisper of the wind. But your caresses in my soul are a hurricane of emotions. 
                                Your eyes, twinkling like stars in the night. Melt the barriers of my being, exposing my vulnerability. 
                                Your presence, a radiant sun lighting up my existence: Yet when you leave, my universe falls into darkness. 
                                Your kisses, like notes in an eternal melody, Transport us to an endless paradise, where time stands still. 
                                You are my treasure, my most precious secret. With every sigh. I confess how deeply I love you. 
                                Thank you for breathing life into my heart. Now that you're gone, it feels like a stone without a beat. 
                                Eagerly awaiting the return of your warm embrace, To once again feel the sweet melody of our love.</p>

                            <p>Poems born from the heart and mind. suffering to find a burning feeling that turned into painful verses, 
                                and here, to you, dear readers, I confide:</p>
                            <p>Love with courage and complete assurance. prepare your heart for the serene test. Cherish those you love with devotion, 
                                and have confidence in your choice. If you do not yet love. perhaps it's better this way. 
                                for love brings pain, though there's no regret. For those who love, with no malice I wish. 
                                that destiny does not play you a cruel trick. Love is beautiful, though with associated risk. 
                                I do not regret having loved. Though it left a void in my wounded heart. 
                                I wish to love again, but when will it start? I now bid farewell, with shame in my soul. but with hope and a bit of calm. 
                                May my words find an echo in you. and may love, though complex, bring you a sweet renewal</p>
